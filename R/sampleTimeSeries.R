#'Sample Of Observational And Experimental Data For Forecast Verification As Area Averages
#'
#'This data set provides area averaged data for the variable 'tos', i.e. sea 
#'surface temperature, over the mediterranean zone from the example datasets 
#'attached to the package. See examples on Load() for more details.\cr\cr
#'The data is provided through a variable named 'sampleTimeSeries' and is 
#'structured as expected from the 'Load()' function in the 's2dverification' 
#'package if was called as follows:\cr\cr

#'@format The data set provides with a variable named 'sampleTimeSeries'.\cr\cr
#'
#'sampleTimeSeries$mod is an array that contains the experimental data and the dimension meanings and values are:\cr
#'  c(# of experimental datasets, # of members, # of starting dates, # of lead-times)\cr
#'  c(1, 3, 5, 60)\cr\cr
#'
#'sampleTimeSeries$obs is an array that contains the observational data and the dimension meanings and values are:\cr
#'  c(# of observational datasets, # of members, # of starting dates, # of lead-times)\cr
#'  c(1, 1, 5, 60)\cr\cr
#'
#'sampleTimeSeries$lat is an array with the 2 latitudes covered by the data that was area averaged to calculate the time series (see examples on Load() for details on why such low resolution).\cr\cr
#'
#'sampleTimeSeries$lon is an array with the 3 longitudes covered by the data that was area averaged to calculate the time series (see examples on Load() for details on why such low resolution).
